	<p>As New York City reopens, its mutual aid networks are passing from crisis mode into a new phase of sustained community support. Groups that originated for emergency food and medicine deliveries are now confronting entrenched community challenges that precede the pandemic, like unemployment, food insecutiy, and rising rents.</p>

	<p>In the neighboring communities of Elmhurst and Corona, once called 'the epicenter of the epicenter' of the global COVID-19 crisis, these mutual aid efforts are especially important. The area is home to the highest rate of foreign-born residents in the city and many are not eligible for government assistance nor unemployment benefits. In Elmhurst and Corona, where one in four residents lives under the poverty line, mutual aid networks are trying to fill this enormous gap in government services, despite limited resources and a high level of need.</p>
